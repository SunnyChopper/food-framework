### Why Build This?
I have a lot of trouble making sure that I eat everything that I buy from a grocery store. Sure there are tons of apps out there that can just keep track of when my food is going to expire. I could even just do it in a spreadsheet. However, things got more complicated for me because I'm really lazy when it comes to doing dishes. Not only did I want something that would tell me what to eat but also keep track of which dishes I have ready to go and which need to be cleaned so that it can recommend only those recipes that can be immediately made without washing any dishes.

### The Future Goals
Eventually, I want to tie in recipes and calories. The main goal of this framework is to make sure that I start eating good and it compliments my efforts made in the gym. Perhaps as more data is entered, I can start to use some of machine learning to help further improve.
